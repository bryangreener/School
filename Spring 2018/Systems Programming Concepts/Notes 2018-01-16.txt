perror (prints stored error string)
use the apue.h header along with error.c method for error handling and returning.
err_ret(const char *fmt, ...) the ... is a variable argument list.

STDIO and Buffers
MMU - Memory Management Unit
    Large part of CPU
    Processes work in User Space and have virtual memory addresses.
    Access to virtual memory goes through MMU to find its location in real memory.

    Kernel Space has no protection and can go anywhere in real memory where it wants. It tells MMU how to translate User Space addresses in virtual memory.
        Contains system calls such as read().
    
stdout data type is FILE *
    Using printf() takes the printf string and pushes it to the FILE * buffer instead of the kernel.
    Then kernel uses the write() function to write the item in buffer.

    Writing stderr goes directly to kernel instead of writing to the buffer.

    When closing program, the buffer should flush.

    stdin is FILE # 0
    stdout is 1
    stderr is 2

    kernel system calls are read() and write(). printf() and other commands like that are not true system calls.

    The kernel write() is not called until the FILE buffer is full or manually flushed.

    putchar puts a single char one at a time into the FILE buffer.

    Can call a function to set size of buffer.

    Can also call write() to directly call the kernel.

Created makefile and a temp.c file in ubuntu CS3240 folder. See these for more information.

To define only if not already defined:
#ifndef ALL_H \\ checks if define already exists.
#define ALL_H \\ if not defined, define
