System Programming Notes 2018-01-09

Three files open when running programs: stdin, stdout, stderr.
stdin: usually assigned to keyboard (buffered)
stdout: normally assigned to console screen (buffered)
stderr: normally assigned to console screen

Data type is FILE *
Buffered stream has a memory buffer in current process that is filled until it makes system call to write to kernal and out to console.

printf  fprintf(stdout, sprintf
scanf   fscanf(stdin,

sprintf prints to string (char str[80]). Same for scanf
