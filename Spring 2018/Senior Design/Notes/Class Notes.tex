\section{Unit Testing}
Qualities of unit tests:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single function
\item Each test is independent and self contained
\item No output unless there is a failure
\item Check all return values and side effects. Side effects are things like changes in DB and changes to global variables and others. Asserts are used to check.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Coming up with Unit Tests}
Think of bad stuff that people can put in. Think of the limits of data input and output. Make sure if using RNG that a seed is set to verify the same results in multiple tests.

\subsection{FIRST Properties of Good Tests}
\begin{itemize}
\item {[}F{]}ast
\item {[}I{]}solated
\item {[}R{]}epeatable
\item {[}S{]}elf-validating
\item {[}T{]}imely
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Right-BICEP}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Right & Are the results right?\\
B & Are all the boundary conditions correct?\\
I & Can you check inverse relationships?\\
C & Can you cross-check results using other means?\\
E & Can you force error conditions to happen?\\
P & Are performance characteristics within bounds?\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{defn}
Boundary conditions are the range of values that values must remain within. An example of this is entering in patient ages where to qualify for a treatment they must be between 50 and 70 yrs old. Anything outside of this range will be denied. An example for our quad solver is for input a we cannot allow the number 0 to be input. Thus we get a boundary condition.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
To force error conditions is just to apply inputs or methods that will definitely cause errors. Then you look for the appropriate error flagging and responses from the program.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Boundary Conditions: "CORRECT"}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conformance\\  Does the value conform to an expected format?
\item Ordering\\  Is the set of values ordered or unordered as appropriate?
\item Range\\  Is the value within reasonable min and max values?
\item Reference\\  Does the code reference anything external that isn't under direct control of the code itself?
\item Existence\\  Does the value exist (is it non-null, nonzero, present in a set, and so on)?
\item Cardinality\\  Are there exactly enough values?
\item Time (abs and rel)\\  Is everything happening in order? At the right time? In time?
\end{itemize}

\section{Ethics Paper Outline}
\subsection{Main Paper}
This section should be around 4 pages long.
\begin{itemize}
\item Title
\item Introduction
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Lead-in Sentence
	\item Short descriptions of sections in paper
	\item Purpose followed by what's coming	
	\end{itemize}

\item Ethics in General (optional)
\item Ethical Standards\\
	Talk about codes of ethics from the IT/Programmer point of view to keep a connection between the ethics and the purpose of this paper.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ACM Ethics
	\item IEEE Ethics
	\end{itemize}
\item Laws\\
	Can talk about international, federal, state, local laws. Mention a couple of these that apply in this setting. Example would be HIPAA, FERPA, copyright, patent, etc.
\item Company Policies\\
	NDA, Non-compete, etc.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Case Studies}
Each case study should be around 2 pages long. Each partner in the project handles one case study on their own.
\begin{itemize}
\item Case Study 1
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Title/Name
	\item Introduction
	\item Case
	\item Their (original study) Analysis
	\item Your Analysis
	\end{itemize}
\item Case Study 2
\item Case Study 3
\end{itemize}

\section{Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
\item CUNIT 2018-02-28
\item After spring break, review quadsolver and make testing plan (written document)\\
These tests do not need to be done in a testing plan, only documented plans:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Tests: Use Cases
	\item Coverage Tests
	\item Automate Tests
	\item UNIT Tests
	\item 508 Compliance (if appropriate)
	\item if web project: are required browsers supported?
	\item Test different OSs
	\item Essentially specify how different project requirements will be tested.
	\item Usability testing (how to get the typical user to test it)
	\item Performance	
	\end{itemize}
	General format of testing plan document:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Title
	\item Introduction with short description of each type of test.
	\item References for how you plan to implement each tests.
	\end{itemize}
\item Main Project Testing Plan
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Feasibility Report}
	Brief piece that goes with material along with final report and for presentation of project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Title
\item Introduction
\item Background Section\\
	This is information on the client and the problem they want solved. For example what services do they have, where are they located, etc. The goal is to show the solution and how it fits into their environment. It also explains their problem (task they need accomplished) and their workflow.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Issues with existing process (if applicable)
	\item Brief possible solutions.
	\end{itemize}
\item Design decisions\\
	List multiple decisions made for the program and compare them. These might not all have been implemented so explain why that idea may have been trashed. Explain reasoning behind certain ideas.
\item Stories/Spikes\\
	For stories split it up into each release.
\item Resources\\
	When will you have the final specs? Explain resources needed to complete project. when will these resources become available? If NDAs are required, when will they be here? etc.
\item Legal
	\begin{itemize}
	\item NDA
	\item Ownership
	\item License
	\item etc.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
