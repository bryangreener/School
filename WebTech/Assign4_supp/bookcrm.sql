With more attention to research—particularly online research—than other handbooks, DK gives students a solid foundation in information literacy. The handbook also presents grammar and documentation (MLA, APA, CMS and CSE) in new ways that makes the material more accessible, including unique “pattern pages” that help students grasp principles visually.\n', 1);
