Graph G(V,E) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges.
    Edges can be ordered or unordered (directed and undirected, respectfully).

Cycle: A cycle is a path {v1,v2,...,vk} in which k>2, then the first (k-1) nodes are distinct and {v1=vk}.

Bipartite Graph
    A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U,V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V.
Complete Bipartite Graph
    Every vertex of the first set U is connected to every vertex in set V.
