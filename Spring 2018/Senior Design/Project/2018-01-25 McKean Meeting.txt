Meeting with McKane

Need to make help file for R functions with helpful comments (like for errors as well)
Some probability functions (like bday problem)
Also want to write a paper explaining what the R functions do and how to use package.
There are also data sets built into the package.
User can also use their own data sets with functions.
Package will be fully public
Some functions will require external packages
    Need rfit package
Want to get this on github as a package eventually
    May or may not have a github account for us to host this on
Intro to Mathematical Statistics 8th Edition (NEED)
help commands in R pull data directly from the manfile in the directory created when creating a function.

See R script example:
    Look up how to add license info in the commands listed
    Need to add LazyLoad in description

R CMD build [mypkg] to build package in bash. Title field in RD is required. This command builds package and gives a package number and a .tar.gz file. To install in R. Run sudo R CMD install [packagename]
At any point in progress you can use the build command.

stat.wmich.edu/mckean/hmchomepage
On this page, there is a link to source commands that you can run in R.

End Goal: Get package on CRAN and if possible submit a journal.


Program Information:
    - Needs a manpage for each function
    - Functions return helpful information on errors
    - Package will include data sets and user will be able to use their own data sets with functions
    - Some functions require 3rd party packages
        -- RFit is an example of one package that is needed
    - Help commands in R pull data from manpage
    - "R CMD build [package name]" in bash will build the package.
        -- Requires Title field
        -- This command can be run at any point
        -- Title field in the RD file is required.
        -- This command builds the packae and gives a package number and a .tar.gz file (maybe .zip in windows?)
    - Need to add license info in the package config
    - Will probably need LazyLoad enabled
Additional Information:
    - The functions needed are in McKean's book Intro to Mathematical Statistics 8th Edition
        -- Many functions are also on his page at stat.wmich.edu/mckean/hmchomepage
    - This package will be fully public. No restrictions.
    - We want to keep this package on github for public access
Main Goal:
    We want to eventually get this package submitted and published on CRAN.
Additional Goals (not needed):
    If everything goes smooth, we can write up a journal to be published regarding this work.
